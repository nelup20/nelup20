### Hi there 👋, I'm Nelu.

I'm a junior software developer working primarily in Java.
Before working with Java professionally, I've mainly had (hobbyist) experience with Javascript and Python.


Some of my hobbies and interests include:
 * Programming, theoretical Computer Science and tech in general 👨‍💻
 * Playing the guitar (mainly Thrash metal) 🎸
 * Learning Japanese (今日本語能力試験N5を勉強します) 🗾
