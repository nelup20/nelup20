# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nelu.

## About ðŸ¤–

I'm a software dev. Largely self-taught. I did however attend [Switchfully](https://switchfully.com/) (only in Belgium!), which allowed me to fill some gaps in my knowledge, solidify my existing skills and kickstart my career as a software dev. Plus I had an awesome time there. 

I'm currently learning theoretical/fundamental CS (following [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)), right now mostly focusing on Computer Architecture & systems/low-level programming.
